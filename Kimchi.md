## Kimchi

Kimchi is more of a procedure/framework than it is an actual recipe. Therefore, _please_ don't stress out about needing to find Napa Cabbage, the perfect nubbin of ginger or Daikon radishes. 

The only thing I recommend is actually getting Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) as they are not very spicy and will impart not only the classic brilliant red color to your finished product, but also delicious notes of fruitiness. 

Some people, including me, also like to use Gochujang (Korean chili flake paste), but that is not mandatory, as part of the prep includes making a sort of Gochujang yourself. The only reason I use it is to give my kimchi paste an extra oomph of flavor and kick-start the fermentation process.

### Ingredients

Veggies

- 1 white/red/napa cabbage (whatever's enough for 2 900ml mason jars)
- 2-3 spring onions

Kimchi paste

- Bread/Rice flour
- Gochujang
- Gochugaru
- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- Chunk of ginger/big pinch of ginger powder

### Prep

Shred/Chunk cabbage into a big bowl, sprinkle a lot of salt on top and massage it in.

Repeat massaging the cabbage once every 20 minutes about 4 times.

In the meantime, add a bit of flour to a pot with not too much water and bring it to a boil while stirring constantly until you have a thick paste.

Allow the paste to cool, then add grated/julienned ginger, crushed garlic, handful of gochugaru, a heaping teaspoon of gochujang and mix well.

After you're done with prepping the cabbage, drain the super-salty liquid off and rinse it 2-3 times and squeeze some of the water out.

Add the paste to the cabbage, massage it in for a minute, then add to jars.

If there's not enough "juice" in the jar to cover the cabbage, even after tamping it in, add a 2% brine to cover.

Ferment it for 4 days, then pop it in the fridge.

It should last you a while, but most likely you'll finish it long before it's not good anymore.

### Uses

- Great on its own as a snack
- If made with shredded cabbage, an amazing relish to put on hotdogs
- Spicy sauerkraut replacement
